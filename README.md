# pyscript-demo
## Demo project to try out PyScript

I started this project because I wanted to see how powerful PyScript is.
I began by printing simple strings and numbers, and later discovered that I could import Python files as scripts.
Then I had the bright idea to use one of my Computational Geometry homework assignments as a script.
This is how the Tetrahedron project began.
